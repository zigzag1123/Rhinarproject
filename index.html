<h3> A Guide to Rhinar, Reckless Rampage<h3>

<p>As the trading card game, Flesh and Blood begins to pick up popularity in its third year, and we approach a brand new draftable set for the game, I thought it would be fun to talk about one of my favorite heroes in the game, Rhinar. Rhinar is a Brute hero who has the normal base stats, 40 hp and 4 intellect. He came out in the original set, Welcome to Rathe. Although Rhinar is one of the oldest heroes in the game, he still hasn't made any big waves in the tournament scene. To underwstand why this is, we first must understand his fundamental keyword, "intimidate." Intimidate is a mechanic that introduces variance into Rhinar's gameplan. intimidate is when the opposing hero has to banish cards at random and face down until the end of turn, removing their opportunity to defend your attacks efficiently. Due to the random nature of this effect, most high level players discredit it as there is always the possibility that you only intimidate the cards they wanted to keep anyway, which effectively does nothing. The newer rhinar strategy though, is one with much more merit. With the expansion set, Everfest, and the classic battles pre-constructed decks coming out. Rhinar has a few new cards to play with that makes intimidating many cards much easier. Cards like high roller and clearing bellow are good examples of this. They are blue, and block three that simply say intimidate go again for 0. Having ways to consistantly take all of your opponents cards or all but one makes Rhinar very good. While many may argue he isn't a tier one hero, he has much more merit with these cards in mind. Another attractive feature Rinar has is the block value on brute cards. Almost all the brute cards block 3. This means that it is almost always easy to extract at least 12 value off any givin 4 cards. Additionally he has access to one of the best cards LSS has ever printed in my opinion, Bloodrush Bellow. (pictured below)</p>

<p>Bloodrush bellow gives Rhinar access to some ridiculous spike turns where he will be dealing 18+ damage which is a comprable rate to most of the premier aggro decks in the format. Where Rhinar has the aggro decks beat however is block value. In Flesh and Blood, cards are balanced numerically as much as possible, this means cards that have offensively high cielings will often have lower defensive cielings. Rhinar, however, has high defensive value on every hand, plus the access to a spike turn that is comprable to the aggro decks. There are pros and cons to this though. In order to win, barring some intimidate shenanigans, Rhinar really wants to see a bloodrush bellow. Luckily, due to the hearty nature of his class, he normally is able to live until he finds it, but there will be games where you either won't find it, or your opponent will never give you a good chance to play itand those games will usually end in a loss.
In conclusion Rhinar is a strong deck with a lot of merit, especially in this Ice dominated meta. With his impressive cardpool, I am very excited to see what LSS brings the brute class in the future.</p>
